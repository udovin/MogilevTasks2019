# Tasks for Mogilev gatherings 2019

# Tutorial for problemsetter
Tasks should be  stored in separate folder at path:
```
tasks/*
```

We recommend, to store solutions (name solutions with your nickname,
if this is not a main solution add suffix like `-ok`, `-wa`, `-tl`, `-group1`)
in path `solutions/`, generators in path `generators/`, statements in path
`statements/`, tests in path `tests/{test_group}/` (samples group is
`samples`, pretest group is `pretests`), and other files like checkers and
validators in path `files/`.
